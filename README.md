# pathfinder
This is a basic pathfinder implemented from scratch.

The following pathfinding alogirthms are included.
## DFS
Depth First Search, explores one path for as long as possible, doesn't guarantee shortest path.
## BFS
Breadth First Search, explores all nodes at a given distance from the starting point before moving to the next distance. Guarantees shortest path.
## A*
Uses the Manhattan Hueristic for a 'guided' search. Guarantees shortest path.
## Sahil SN
Sahil Same-Node, expands the same number of nodes from both ends in a BFS fashion. Guarantees shortest path.
## Sahil SD
Sahil Same-Depth, expands the same number of 'levels' from each end in a bfs fashion. Guarantees shortest path.
